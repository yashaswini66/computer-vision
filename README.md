Computer vision filters are essential tools used to process and enhance images1
. They modify the pixel values of an image to achieve various effects, such as smoothing, sharpening, or edge detection1
. Here are some common types of computer vision filters:

Moving Average Filter: Replaces each pixel with the average value of its neighboring pixels, resulting in a smoother image1
.

Gaussian Filter: Uses a Gaussian function to blur the image, reducing noise and smoothing out variations2
.

Edge Detection Filters: Highlight the edges within an image by detecting changes in pixel intensity1
. Examples include the Sobel and Canny filters.

Sharpening Filters: Enhance the edges and fine details in an image by emphasizing the differences in pixel values1
.

Image Segmentation Filters: Partition the image into regions with similar attributes, making it easier to identify objects and boundaries1
.

These filters are widely used in applications like photo editing, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles to improve image quality and extract valuable information
